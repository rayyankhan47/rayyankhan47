<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Rayyan Khan</h1>

# 💫 About Me:
I am a second-year computer science student at McGill University. The overaching theme of my journey as a developer is to leverage my skills in Machine Learning and building robust web applications for the sake of social impact.
I want to build something interesting with you! Hit me up and let's create a beautiful project together. 

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- 💻 Building MERN/PERN applications with Next.Js
- 🎨 I am currently working on: A start-up to solve certain problems in the Québec collegial academic sphere 🤔

## 🎓 Fun facts

- 🥇 I love high pressure hackathon-type situations where my friends and I can *suffer* for 48 hours and come up with something all worth it at the end.
- 😃 Team projects are my thing. Hence, I *really* mean it when I ask you to hit me up if you want to work on something cool with me.
- 🌍 I strive in all things social impact. Through my experience in education advocacy, I've honed my communication skills and reinforced my belief in the transformative power of storytelling.
- ❣️ Math is where it all began for me (I was a math major before throwing myself to the world of CS and potential unemployment 🥶). I am particularly interested in Graph Theory and Algebraic Topology.
- 🏸 I play competitive badminton when I'm not staring at a screen 🤑
